        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that 
            has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative,
             and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries 
             or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <uo class="ingredients">
            <li>Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>Whole Milk</li>
            <li>Cane Sugar</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li class="sherry">Do not add cheese</li>
        </uo>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, 
                and salt. Warm over medium-low heat, whisking often, for 5 minutes,
                 or until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is warmed through.</li>

            <li>Pour into a heatproof bowl, cover, and chill for 2 hours or overnight.</li>

            <li>Remove the chilled ice cream base from the fridge and whisk well.
                 Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions,
                  typically 20 to 30 minutes. The ice cream will be soft after 
                  churning. For firmer ice cream, transfer to an airtight container
                   and freeze for 2 to 4 hours before serving.</li>
                   
            <li>Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to a month.
                 If the ice cream is too firm to scoop straight from the freezer,
                  let sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften.</li>

        </ol>
